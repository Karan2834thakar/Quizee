🎉 Introducing Quizee: A Quiz App Built with Node.js and React! 🎉

Excited to share a project that I and my friend Suketu Rola worked on together! 🚀

Project Overview:

We built Quizee, a quiz app where users can test their knowledge through interactive questions. Here's how it works:

Each question has 4 options.

On selecting an answer:

✅ Correct Answer: Turns green.

❌ Wrong Answer: The correct answer turns green, and the selected answer turns red.

A Next button allows users to move to the next question effortlessly.


Our Work:


💻 Backend:

We developed the RESTful API using Node.js, Express, JSON, and CORS. The API is hosted on Render and efficiently serves the quiz questions.

🎨 Frontend:

We designed and built the React-based frontend, fetching data using Axios and styling it with TailwindCSS for a seamless user experience.

What We Learned:

Collaborative development across frontend and backend.

Using tools like Axios for API integration and Render for API hosting.

Enhancing UI/UX with interactive features and clean designs.

Strengthened our teamwork skills by dividing responsibilities, communicating effectively, and combining efforts to deliver a polished product.

This project was a great learning experience, and we’re thrilled to share it with the community. Check it out and let us know your feedback! 🙌
